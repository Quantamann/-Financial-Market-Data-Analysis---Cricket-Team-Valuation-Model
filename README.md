Data analysis techniques to evaluate and select the best cricket team from the 2022 T20 World Cup data.
I’m excited to share a project I recently completed, where I used data analysis techniques to evaluate and select the best cricket team from the 2022 T20 World Cup data. 🏏 

Tools used: Python(Beautifulsoup, pandas) , Power BI

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how I approached it:
🔎 Project Workflow:

1. Data Acquisition via Scraping(python):
Utilized Beautifulsoup in Python to scrape player data from ESPN’s T20 World Cup page. Extracted relevant player stats such as runs, wickets, batting average, economy, etc. for each player in the tournament.

2. Data Wrangling (Python/Pandas):
Integrated multiple data sources into a unified dataset using Pandas. Enhanced data quality through cleaning, transforming, and merging tables, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing column names for improved consistency. The refined dataset was then exported as a CSV file for seamless integration with Power BI.

3. Data Modeling & Preparation (Power BI): 
Imported cleaned data into Power BI, leveraging Power Query for further transformations, building relations between tables and filtering. Developed custom DAX measures and calculated columns to model Key Performance Metrics (bowling economy, strike rate, wickets, etc) and facilitate player comparisons.

4. Data Visualization (Power BI): 
Created a user-friendly, interactive Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive and intuitive experience for analyzing player performance. Key features include parameter-based player comparisons, enabling users to easily compare players across various metrics. Dynamic filtering by player roles (batsman, bowler, all-rounder) and performance metrics provided granular control over the data displayed. A range of visualizations, including charts (e.g., bar, line, scatter), were integrated to enhance data exploration and support data-driven insights.

🎯 Outcome:
The final dashboard enables comprehensive analysis, helping users conduct in-depth player performance analysis, compare statistics, and support data-driven team selection decisions. This tool can be used by cricket analysts, enthusiasts, and teams for detailed performance reviews.
